# Mine-vs-Rock-Prediction-
The **Mine Detection** project aims to classify objects as either **"mines"** or **"rocks"** based on sonar data. Sonar signals are used to identify whether an object detected underwater is a metallic mine or just a rock. This project is a practical implementation of **binary classification** in machine learning.

---

### **Project Objective**
The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can analyze sonar signals (numerical data) and accurately classify them into one of two categories:
1. **Mine (Metallic Object)**  
2. **Rock (Non-Metallic Object)**  

By training the model on a labeled dataset of sonar signal data, the project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied in real-world scenarios such as underwater object detection and military applications.

### **Dataset**
The project uses the **Sonar Dataset**, a commonly used dataset in machine learning projects. Key points about the dataset:
- It contains **numerical features** representing sonar signals reflected off objects.
- Each row represents the sonar readings for a single observation.
- The last column of the dataset provides the **class labels**:
  - **"M"** for Mine
  - **"R"** for Rock

### **Steps in the Project**
1. **Data Import and Exploration**:
   - The dataset is read into a pandas DataFrame.
   - Initial exploratory analysis is performed to:
     - Understand the structure (number of rows, columns).
     - Identify class distributions to ensure a balanced dataset.
     - Observe summary statistics of the features (e.g., mean, standard deviation).

2. **Data Splitting**:
   - The dataset is divided into **training** and **testing** sets using `train_test_split` from the `sklearn` library.
   - This ensures the model is trained on one part of the data and evaluated on unseen data for unbiased performance testing.

3. **Model Selection**:
   - The project uses **Logistic Regression**, a simple and interpretable algorithm for binary classification problems.
   - Logistic Regression calculates the probability of an observation belonging to a specific class (mine or rock) and makes predictions based on this probability.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - The model is trained on the training set to learn patterns in sonar signals.
   - Predictions are made on the testing set, and the model's accuracy is calculated using **accuracy_score**.

### **Applications**
This project has real-world implications, such as:
- **Military Operations**: Detecting underwater mines for safe navigation of ships and submarines.
- **Marine Exploration**: Differentiating between rocks and other objects during underwater exploration.
- **Industrial Use**: Applications in pipeline inspections and underwater construction.

### **Conclusion**
The project is a great example of applying machine learning to solve a classification problem. It showcases how:
- Data preprocessing, exploration, and modeling are done.
- Logistic Regression can be used effectively for binary classification tasks.
- The results can be used to make informed decisions in high-stakes domains like underwater navigation and security.
